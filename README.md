# CP386 Assignment 4

## Motivation

Many computer processes require the use of multiple resources of multiple types at once to complete their work. However, using those resources haphazardly can result in the system being deadlocked, and unable to continue.

The Banker's Algorithm solved this problem by ensuring that each process' request for resources is satisfied only if it does not result in a potential deadlock in the future, and allows all processes to be serviced.
